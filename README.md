# TPMS analysis

This repository contains tools to perform analysis on Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS). We assume that data has been collected by a network of sensors using [`rtl_433`](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433) and then fed to an [`InfluxDB`](https://www.influxdata.com/) instance.
